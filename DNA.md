#### Epigenetics
- A good part of who we are inherited from Mom and Dad.
- They are written in our genes.
- Many factors can affect how our genes are expressed:
  - where we live
  - what we eat
  - how much we exercise
  - environmental factors
- You know that changes in DNA and RNA can produce changes in proteins.
- Additional control happens at the level of DNA, even though these changes do not alter DNA directly. 
- Inherited factors that do not change the DNA sequence of nucleotides are called **epigenetic** changes.
- They make each of us unique.
- Epigenetic means, literally, "upon" or "over" genetics. 
- It describes a type of chemical reaction that can alter the physical properties of DNA without changing its sequence. 
- These changes make genes either more or less likely to be expressed.
