#### Epigenetics
- A good part of who we are inherited from Mom and Dad.
- They are written in our genes.
- Many factors can affect how our genes are expressed:
  - where we live
  - what we eat
  - how much we exercise
  - environmental factors
- You know that changes in DNA and RNA can produce changes in proteins.
- Additional control happens at the level of DNA, even though these changes do not alter DNA directly. 
- Inherited factors that do not change the DNA sequence of nucleotides are called **epigenetic** changes.
- They make each of us unique.
- Epigenetic means, literally, "upon" or "over" genetics. 
- It describes a type of chemical reaction that can alter the physical properties of DNA without changing its sequence. 
- These changes make genes either more or less likely to be expressed.

#### Chromatin
- DNA is spooled up compactly inside cells in an arrangement called **chromatin**. 
- Chromatin consists of long strings of DNA spooled around a compact assembly of proteins called **histones**.
- The key function of chromatin is to control access to genes, since not all genes are turned on at the same time.
- Improper expression of growth-promoting genes can lead to: 
   - cancer
   - birth defects
   - other health concerns
- Histones have special chemical tags that act like switches to control access to the DNA.
- These switches are called **epigenetic markings**.
- They unwind the spooled DNA so the genes can be transcribed.
- A cell's gene-reading machinery tracks epigenetic markings.
- This hypothesis has been called **histone code**.
- It could play a major role in determining which proteins get made in a cell.

#### Imprinting
- It affects gene activity
- Only the mother's or the father's gene copy is switched on regardless of the child's gender. 
- The genes are chemically marked, or **imprinted**, during the process that generates eggs and sperm.
- The embryo that emerges from the joining of egg and sperm can tell whether a gene copy came from Mom or Dad, so it knows which copy of the gene to shut off.

#### Starting at the End
- Some DNA sequences are different: They don't encode RNAs or proteins. 
     - **Introns* are in this category
- **Telomeres** are also in this category.
- They are the ends of chromosomes
- Without telomeres, chromosomes stick to each other and cause cells to undergo harmful changes like dividing abnormally.
- The telomeres of almost all organisms have repeated sequences of DNA with lots of Ts and Gs.
- The number of telomere repeats varies enormously, not just from organism to organism but in different cells of the same organism and even within a single cell over time.
- The cell has an enzyme that copies of the repeated sequence to the telomeres of some but not all chromosomes.
- The telomerase enzyme consists of a protein and an RNA component, which the enzyme uses as a template for copying the repeated DNA sequence.
-  As cells divide again and again, their telomeres get shorter.
-  Most normal cells stop dividing when their telomeres wear down to a certain point, and eventually the cells die. 
-  Telomerase can counteract the shortening by: 
      - adding DNA to telomeres
      - telomerase rebuilds the telomere
      - resets the cell's molecular clock
- The enzyme might play important roles in cancer and aging
