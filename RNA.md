# RNA
- The chemical units of RNA are like those of DNA, except that RNA has the nucleotide uracil (U) instead of thymine (T). 
- RNA usually comes as only a single strand.
- RNA nucleotides contain ribose sugar molecules in place of deoxyribose.
- RNA is quite flexible.
- RNA can twist itself into a variety of complicated, three-dimensional shapes.
- RNA is unstable.
- Cells constantly break it down
- RNA's instability lets cells change their patterns of protein synthesis very quickly in response to what's going on around them.
