# RNA
- The chemical units of RNA are like those of DNA, except that RNA has the nucleotide uracil (U) instead of thymine (T). 
- RNA usually comes as only a single strand.
- RNA nucleotides contain ribose sugar molecules in place of deoxyribose.
- RNA is quite flexible.
- RNA can twist itself into a variety of complicated, three-dimensional shapes.
- RNA is unstable.
- Cells constantly break it down
- RNA's instability lets cells change their patterns of protein synthesis very quickly in response to what's going on around them.

#### Molecular Editor
- Editing a gene's mRNA can radically change the resulting protein's function. 
- RNA editing can get more proteins out of the same number of genes. 
- The class of editors are molecules called **adenosine deaminases**. 
- These enzymes "retype" RNA letters at various places within an mRNA transcript.
- Understanding the details of this process is an important area of medical research.

#### microRNA
- They consists of only a few dozen nucleotides, compared to typical human mRNAs that are a few thousand nucleotides long.
- Many of them arise from DNA that used to be considered merely filler material.
- They start out much bigger but get trimmed by cellular enzymes, including one aptly named **Dicer**. 
- microRNAs stick to certain mRNA molecules and stop them from passing on their protein-making instructions.
