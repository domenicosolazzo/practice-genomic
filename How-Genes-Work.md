# How genes work

- Living things inherit traits from their parents.
- Genes are what carry our traits through generations. 
- Genes are made of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).
- They serve as instruction books for making functional molecules such as ribonucleic acid (RNA) and proteins.
- RNA and proteins perform the chemical reactions in our bodies.

- Proteins provide the body's main building materials, forming the cell's architecture and structural components. 
- Proteins can't do is make copies of themselves. 
- When a cell needs more proteins, it uses the manufacturing instructions coded in DNA.
- The DNA code of a geneâ€”the sequence of its individual DNA building blocks (nucleotides):
   - A (adenine)
   - T (thymine)
   - C (cytosine)
   - G (guanine)
- DNA code spells out the exact order of a protein's building blocks, amino acids.
- An error in the gene's DNA sequence is called **mutation**
