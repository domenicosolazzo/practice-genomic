# How genes work

- Living things inherit traits from their parents.
- Genes are what carry our traits through generations. 
- Genes are made of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).
- They serve as instruction books for making functional molecules such as ribonucleic acid (RNA) and proteins.
- RNA and proteins perform the chemical reactions in our bodies.

- Proteins provide the body's main building materials, forming the cell's architecture and structural components. 
- Proteins can't do is make copies of themselves. 
- When a cell needs more proteins, it uses the manufacturing instructions coded in DNA.
- The DNA code of a geneâ€”the sequence of its individual DNA building blocks (nucleotides):
   - A (adenine)
   - T (thymine)
   - C (cytosine)
   - G (guanine)
- DNA code spells out the exact order of a protein's building blocks, amino acids.
- DNA consists of two long, twisted chains made up of nucleotides. 
    - Each nucleotide contains one base, one phosphate molecule and the sugar molecule deoxyribose. 
    - The bases in DNA nucleotides are adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine.
- Long strings of nucleotides form genes.
- Groups of genes are packaged tightly into structures called chromosomes. 
- Every cell in your body contains a full set of chromosomes in its nucleus except for eggs, sperm and red blood cells.

### Mutation
- An error in the gene's DNA sequence is called **mutation**
- A mutation can cause a gene to encode a protein that works incorrectly or that doesn't work at all. Sometimes, the error means that no protein is made.
- Not all DNA changes are harmful. 
- Some mutations have no effect, and others produce new versions of proteins that may give a survival advantage to the organisms that have them. 

#### Copycat
- A cell must reproduce.
- Cell must copy the DNA before dividing in two almost identical cells.
- The twisted double helix of the DNA must unwind and create two separate strand.
- Each strand becomes a pattern for a new strand.
- The new DNA will have one new strand and one old strand.
- This copy is done by a cellular proteine machine called **DNA polymerase**.
- It reads the DNA strand and stiches a new complementary one.
- This process is called **replication**.
- The process is fast and accurate but sometimes errors can happen. Most of them are fixed immediately.
- Not correct errors can lead to disease, such cancer.

#### Meiosis
- After copying the DNA, cell needs to find enough genetic materials for the two offspring.
- Most cells are called **diploid** because they have two sets of chromosomes (23 pairs).
- Eggs and sperm are known as **haploid**
- Each haploid has only one set of chromosomes.
- A haploid egg cell will combine with a haploid sperm cell to form a diploid cell with the right number of chromosomes (46).
- Chromosomes are numbered from 1 to 22, where 1 is the largest chromosome.
- The 23rd pair, known as the **sex chromosomes**, are called **X** and **Y**.
- Abnormalities of chromosome number usually occur during **meiosis**, the time when a cell reduces its chromosomes from diploid to haploid in creating eggs or sperm.
- Mistakes in dividing DNA between daughter cells during meiosis are the leading cause of human birth defects and miscarriages.
- In women, the likelihood that chromosomes won't be apportioned properly increases with age.
- **Trisomy**, the hallmark of Down syndrome, results when a baby is born with three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the usual two.
- In healthy cells, gluelike protein complexes called **cohesins** release pairs of chromosomes at exactly the right time. This allows the chromosomes to separate properly.

#### Transcription
- There two main steps to make proteins.
- First one is called **transcription**: the information coded in DNA is transferred to RNA
- The RNA nucleotides are complementary to those of DNA.
- The only difference is that the RNA nucloutide pairs uracil(U), instead of T, with A.
- A proteine machine called **RNA polymerase** reads the DNA and make the RNA copy, called **mRNA**.
- mRNA transports the gene's message to the protein-producing machinery
- RNA polymerase gets help from helper proteins, 'expressing' only particular genes.
- On ribosome, **tRNA** (transfer RNA) helps to convert mRNA to proteins.
- Amino acids links together to create proteins.

#### RNA splicing
- Several types of RNA play key roles in making a protein:
  - The gene transcript (the mRNA) transfers information from DNA in the nucleus to the ribosomes that make protein.
  - Ribosomal RNA. 
  - Transfer RNA carries amino acids to the ribosomes.
- The genetic material of humans and other eukaryotes includes a lot of DNA that doesn't encode proteins
- Some of this DNA is stuck right in the middle of genes.
- We have two types of DNA:
  - **exons**: A DNA sequence in a gene that codes for a gene product.
  - **introns**: A DNA sequencethat interrupts the sequences coding for an exon.
- The cell needs to trim out the intron sections and then stitch only the exon pieces together
- In this way, we will get the mRNA molecule that yields a working protein.
- This is called **RNA splicing**.
- Splicing has to be extremely accurate. 
- An error in the splicing process will throw the whole sequence out of alignment. The result is usually an abnormal protein or no protein at all. 
- Introns are important part of splicing.
- Without them, a cell would not need the splicing process and keep monitoring it to be sure it's working right.
- Splicing make it possible to create multiple proteins.
- By cutting and pasting the exons in different patterns is called **alternative splicing**.
- A cell can create different proteins from a single gene. 
- Alternative splicing is one of the reasons why human cells, which have about 20,000 genes, can make hundreds of thousands of different proteins.

#### Translation
- The next step is reading the RNA information and fitting the building blocks of a protein together. 
- This is called **translation**, and its principal actors are the ribosome and amino acids.
- The messenger RNA threads through the ribosome protein machine.
- The ribosome reads the mRNA sequence and helps recognize and recruit the correct amino acid-carrying transfer RNA to match the mRNA code. 
- The ribosome also links each additional amino acid into a growing protein chain.
