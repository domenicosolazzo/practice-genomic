# How genes work

- Living things inherit traits from their parents.
- Genes are what carry our traits through generations. 
- Genes are made of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).
- They serve as instruction books for making functional molecules such as ribonucleic acid (RNA) and proteins.
- RNA and proteins perform the chemical reactions in our bodies.

- Proteins provide the body's main building materials, forming the cell's architecture and structural components. 
- Proteins can't do is make copies of themselves. 
- When a cell needs more proteins, it uses the manufacturing instructions coded in DNA.
- The DNA code of a geneâ€”the sequence of its individual DNA building blocks (nucleotides):
   - A (adenine)
   - T (thymine)
   - C (cytosine)
   - G (guanine)
- DNA code spells out the exact order of a protein's building blocks, amino acids.
- DNA consists of two long, twisted chains made up of nucleotides. 
    - Each nucleotide contains one base, one phosphate molecule and the sugar molecule deoxyribose. 
    - The bases in DNA nucleotides are adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine.
- Long strings of nucleotides form genes.
- Groups of genes are packaged tightly into structures called chromosomes. 
- Every cell in your body contains a full set of chromosomes in its nucleus except for eggs, sperm and red blood cells.

### Mutation
- An error in the gene's DNA sequence is called **mutation**
- A mutation can cause a gene to encode a protein that works incorrectly or that doesn't work at all. Sometimes, the error means that no protein is made.
- Not all DNA changes are harmful. 
- Some mutations have no effect, and others produce new versions of proteins that may give a survival advantage to the organisms that have them. 

#### Copycat
- A cell must reproduce.
- Cell must copy the DNA before dividing in two almost identical cells.
- The twisted double helix of the DNA must unwind and create two separate strand.
- Each strand becomes a pattern for a new strand.
- The new DNA will have one new strand and one old strand.
- This copy is done by a cellular proteine machine called **DNA polymerase**.
- It reads the DNA strand and stiches a new complementary one.
- This process is called **replication**.
- The process is fast and accurate but sometimes errors can happen. Most of them are fixed immediately.
- Not correct errors can lead to disease, such cancer.

#### Meiosis
- After copying the DNA, cell needs to find enough genetic materials for the two offspring.
- Most cells are called **diploid** because they have two sets of chromosomes (23 pairs).
- Eggs and sperm are known as **haploid**
- Each haploid has only one set of chromosomes.
- A haploid egg cell will combine with a haploid sperm cell to form a diploid cell with the right number of chromosomes (46).
- Chromosomes are numbered from 1 to 22, where 1 is the largest chromosome.
- The 23rd pair, known as the **sex chromosomes**, are called **X** and **Y**.
- Abnormalities of chromosome number usually occur during **meiosis**, the time when a cell reduces its chromosomes from diploid to haploid in creating eggs or sperm.
- Mistakes in dividing DNA between daughter cells during meiosis are the leading cause of human birth defects and miscarriages.
- In women, the likelihood that chromosomes won't be apportioned properly increases with age.
- **Trisomy**, the hallmark of Down syndrome, results when a baby is born with three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the usual two.
- In healthy cells, gluelike protein complexes called **cohesins** release pairs of chromosomes at exactly the right time. This allows the chromosomes to separate properly.

#### Transcription
- There two main steps to make proteins.
- First one is called **transcription**: the information coded in DNA is transferred to RNA
- The RNA nucleotides are complementary to those of DNA.
- The only difference is that the RNA nucloutide pairs uracil(U), instead of T, with A.
- A proteine machine called **RNA polymerase** reads the DNA and make the RNA copy, called **mRNA**.
- mRNA transports the gene's message to the protein-producing machinery
- RNA polymerase gets help from helper proteins, 'expressing' only particular genes.
- On ribosome, **tRNA** (transfer RNA) helps to convert mRNA to proteins.
- Amino acids links together to create proteins.
